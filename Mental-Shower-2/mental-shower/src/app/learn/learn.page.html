      <p>Your body's temperature has a high influence on your biological rythm. <br><br>
        Everytime a person is exposed to extreme temperatures, the body will try to generate more heat or it will hardly try to cope with it.<br> <br>Therefore, the person might feel exhausted. <br><br>
        This can be easily recognised by noticing a decrease/increase in the heart beat.

      <p>Humidity is another parameter that can affect your mood. <br><br>
        Whenever you notice a change in the way your body perceives temperatures, then you simply might need to drink water. <br><br>
        Your overall awareness comes into play but it is easy to know this, as you could be experiencing thirst or dry lips.</p>

        Did you know that draught is often experienced as "uncomfortable"? <br><br>
        When you are indoors and the airspeed is too high, then headaches, ears pain or the sensation of being cold can be felt.<br><br>
        This can be very unpleasant and can seriously affect your mood. <br><br>
        Consider closing the source of air like windows, doors or fans.
